# reactexampleapp
I created this app when I was learning HTML/CSS/JS and React. I am completely sure that it is still not enough for a person who wants to be web developer.
But I am completely sure about that I am going to learn this.

What is in the Project:

- Deal Page takes Data from JSON file and sends Items component with map() function.

- In the Header Component, website shows you how many items in the body.

- In the header the is a button that named "Giriş Yap" (Sign In in Turkish). When you click that it opens a modal with Sign In Page.(Sign In not working.)

- All of items in JSON listed in body in card template.

- You can enter that cards by clicking their buttons.

- When user click the buttons that in the card. Website directs the user to the Details Page.

- In the Details Page there is some extra informations about selected card that not seen in the card that in the main page. 

P.S: I created this in Turkish language.
