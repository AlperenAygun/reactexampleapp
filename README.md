# reactexampleapp
I created this app when I was learning HTML/CSS/JS and React. I am completely sure that it is still not enough for a person who wants to be web developer.
But I am completely sure about that I am going to learn this.

What is in the Project:

- Deal Page takes Data from JSON file and sends Items component with map() function.

- In the Header Component, website shows you how many items in the body.

- In the header the is a button that named "Giri≈ü Yap" (Sign In in Turkish). When you click that it opens a modal with Sign In Page.(Sign In not working.)
